# Data Visualization

## Folder Example Connector

Simple anonymous connector that fetches something from the database.


To make this work with your own App, replace the following values:

const APP_ID = "<your Realm app ID here>"; // e.g. myapp-abcde
const db = "<your Atlas database name here>"; // e.g. publibike
const stationsCollection = "<your Atlas collection name here>"; // e.g. bikes

## Folder Library

Self-Hosted instance of leaflet-heatmap.js to display heatmaps in leaflet, because CDN was not working.
